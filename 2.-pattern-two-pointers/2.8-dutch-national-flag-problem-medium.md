# 2.8 Dutch National Flag Problem \(medium\)

Elements before low are 0, above high are 2
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n=arr.size();
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1;
    while (mid <= high)
    {
        // if we have 0, then we'll swap them and increase the value of low, so that next 0 could be accommodated there
        if (arr[mid] == 0)
            swap(arr[low++], arr[mid++]);
        // if we get 1, then there's no need of swapping
        else if (arr[mid] == 1)
            mid++;
        // getting 2 will need swapping of high and mid, we will decrement high afterthat
        else if (arr[mid] == 2)
            swap(arr[mid], arr[high--]);
    }
    }
};
```
